LoadTracker is a basic CRUD app designed for trucking companies to be able to easily keep tabs on their loads. The app currently allows users to view a list of their loads, add loads as needed and delete them when they are done. Each load will have a driver, destination, customer and deliverdate assigned to it. 

Future versions of the app will give users the ability to view their loads by driver, destination, customer and delivery date. Currently the view simply displays all loads in a scrollable table. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
